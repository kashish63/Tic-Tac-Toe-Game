# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A game coded in C++ language and Artificial Intelligence algorithm called Minimax algorithm

A game in which two players alternately put Xs and Os in compartments of a figure formed by two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines and each tries to get a row of three Xs or three Os before the opponent does.
I made this game in a single code file to easily understanable and also can play on any system.
